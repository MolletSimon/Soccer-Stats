# Soccer Data
Maybe the worst app name you've ever seen

## Data
I get the data from an API call football-data.org, it contains a free API Key that allows you to make 10 calls per minutes so this app is not meant to be publish on stores

Clone the project with this command
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MolletSimon/Soccer-Stats.git

Once the project clone, just install the node_modules with the command 
```bash
npm install

## Run 
You can run a test server with the command
```bash
ionic serve
```
it will open the navigator at localhost:8100, press F12 and then Ctrl + Shift + M
